    Identify snippets from the markdown resume - {resume} that contain gaps, are irrelevant, contain errors, are inconsistent, or are otherwise problematic. Focus on the following guidelines to ensure high-quality resumes for Indian students with PGDM or MBA degrees:

    - Clarity: Ensure information is clearly presented and easy to understand
    - Quantifiable Achievements: Look for achievements that lack specific metrics or numbers
    - Gaps and Red Flags: Note unexplained gaps or concerning items
    - Consistency: Verify consistent formatting, dates, and details throughout
    - Professional Tone: Ensure language maintains appropriate professionalism
    - Skills Emphasis: Check if key skills are properly highlighted

    The identified snippets will guide questions for the candidate, ensuring resume updates are factually accurate. Generate only 5 snippets. {evaluation}

   
  
  expected_output: >
    A JSON array containing problematic snippets extracted WORD TO WORD from the resume data, also mention the reason for the snippet being problematic in short.
